# Java-Login-GUI

This is a small GUI test project I made with two Java files each loading a different GUI.

The first, GUI.java loads a small window that has a clickable button that increments the count in the window.

The second, LoginGUI.java creates a small Login window that checks to see if the username and password are "Jordan" and "Hornback" respectively

They don't really do anything, but were my first steps learning about swing and GUIs made with Java
